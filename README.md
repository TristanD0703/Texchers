__To move a piece:__
1. Enter the letter and number combination of the piece. Lines from top - bottom are listed A-B, and left - right are listed 1-8
2. Enter the letter and number combination of the tile you want to move the piece

If you're able to, you can capture a piece by jumping over the enemy piece.

The game ends when all the pieces on one team are captured.
